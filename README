This patch allows Yubico Yubiradius to support OTP only authentication, functionality that gives more flexibility to the already brilliant Yubikey.

Follow the below intructions to patch your Yubradius instance, currently only v3_5_1 is supported. I take no responsibility if you hose your Yubiradius server.

1. download ropverify_v351.patch

2. Backup your ropverify.php
cp ropverify.php ropverify.php.bak

3. Patch ropverify.php
patch ropverify.php > ropverify_v351.patch

4. The file should be complete, but you still need to enable OTP only logins.
nano ropverify.php

5. Find the line that reads,
$otpOnlyAuthAllow = 0; //change to enable OTP only

Change 0 to 1 and save the file.
